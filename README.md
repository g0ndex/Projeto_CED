  - Sequential implementation code (`canny_sequential.c`).
  - Basic `CMakeLists.txt` file for compilation.
- **Purpose**: Serves as a baseline for performance comparison against parallel and GPU-optimized versions.

### 2. **Vers√£o-Sequencial**
- **Description**: This branch expands on the sequential implementation with additional comments, fixes, and debugging information.
- **Content**:
  - Enhanced sequential implementation (`canny_sequential.c`).
  - Detailed comments explaining gradient computation and suppression.
- **Purpose**: A polished version of the sequential algorithm to establish a foundation for further optimization.

### 3. **Vers√£o-OpenMP**
- **Description**: Introduces parallelization of the Canny Edge Detection algorithm using OpenMP.
- **Content**:
  - Parallelized implementation (`canny_openmp.c`) leveraging multi-core CPUs.
  - Benchmarking integration to measure speedup and efficiency.
- **Key Optimizations**:
  - Divided workload across multiple threads using OpenMP `#pragma` directives.
  - Efficient memory access to prevent thread contention.
- **Purpose**: Demonstrates how parallelism can significantly improve performance for edge detection.

### 4. **Vers√£o-GPU**
- **Description**: Implements the Canny Edge Detection algorithm using CUDA for GPU acceleration.

  - CUDA-based implementation (`canny_gpu.cu`) for NVIDIA GPUs.
  - Optimizations for global memory access and thread block distribution.
  - Compatibility with CUDA 12.4 (tested on NVIDIA A100 GPUs).
- **Purpose**: Showcases the computational power of GPUs for handling large-scale image processing tasks efficiently.

### 5. **Vers√£o-Medi√ß√£o-Tempos**
- **Description**: Focuses on benchmarking the performance of the algorithm across different implementations (Sequential, OpenMP, and GPU).
- **Content**:
  - Script (`run_benchmark.sh`) to automate benchmarking for multiple matrix sizes.
  - CSV file (`benchmark_results.csv`) for recording execution times and speedup.
  - OpenMP, CUDA, and sequential versions for testing.
- **Purpose**: Provides a robust evaluation framework for analyzing the efficiency of each implementation.

### 6. **Vers√£o-Benchmarking-CMake**
- **Description**: Contains a consolidated setup using CMake for building all implementations (Sequential, OpenMP, and GPU) with ease.
- **Content**:
  - Comprehensive `CMakeLists.txt` for cross-platform compatibility.
  - Scripts to build and run benchmarks.
- **Purpose**: Simplifies the compilation process and ensures a unified build system for all implementations.
